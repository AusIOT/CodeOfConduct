# Code Of Conduct Overview

The AusIOT meetup is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, regardless of race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, religion, and mental and physical ability.

Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication, and we do not tolerate harassment in any form. For more information, see our reporting guidelines listed in our [full Code of Conduct](./CoC.md).

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the CoC template at Write the Docs http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct-shortform-meetups/
